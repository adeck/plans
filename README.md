# plans

The best laid plans of mice and men do often get their own git repository.

This repo is a place for me to easily keep track of ideas for things which I want to complete. Ideas for software, hardware, firmware, or operations projects that I think would either be fun, eminently useful, or both. And a place for me to flesh out those ideas before I actually begin coding anything. A place where I can document what direction I want various things to take, why I want them to go that way, and how I plan on making those things happen.

It's just... I've seen so many projects where people just started coding something before they considered why they wanted to use a given process or technology, and how they wanted things structured. Or where people *did* know that initially, but compleely forgot about that halfway through.

And yeah, everything's probably getting committed directly to master, because why not.
