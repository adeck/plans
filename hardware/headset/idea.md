Basically, I want to do the actual phone handset part of [this][]. I have an ohmeter, an old phone handset, a soldering iron,
an audio cable, and a desire to see someone's face when my phone rings and I pull a phone handset out of my pocket to answer
the call.

> one pair showed 150 Ω (that's the speaker); one pair showed 200 kΩ (that's the mic).

...Looks pretty straightforward, really. Seems like I'd probably also want to invest in shrinkwrap tubing, but that's another
matter entirely.

## Update

So, I've stripped the wires for the RJ11 cable to my satisfaction, and done the same to a TRS cable. Scoped the handset so I know which cables go to what and scoped the phone cable leads so I know which is which on the TRS cable. Hell, I even held wires together with my fingers and played some music throught the handset speaker.

And then I found out that my phone (and pretty much every other phone under the sun) requires a TRRS cable for mic + audio, despite the fact that I really only need three leads (mono audio, mono speaker, ground). But whatever. Guess I just need to find, cut, strip, and scope a TRRS cable. Sucks, though; I can't remember the last time I saw one lying around, which means I'll probably be forced to actually go out and buy one. Which brings the cost of this project form zero dollars and zero cents up by about an infinite percent.
